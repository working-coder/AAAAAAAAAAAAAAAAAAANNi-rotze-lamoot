# 24HourProject
 
Hello
We are some people (Idan and Yair (YAIR - Yet Another Intelligent Robot))
We are trying to stay up all night and code

We will be tired

I'm writing this at 12:42
12 minutes after we started

I'll update again soon <3

## 12:51
Guys, I already want to die.

It's been 9 minutes since the last update.
The repository is already dead. We merged 3 times in the last 5 minutes.

Thank you for your time.
